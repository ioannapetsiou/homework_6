# homework_6
My submission for homework 6
**Homework 6** includes two jupyter notebooks
**01-Animals** where I had to work with a small .csv file that I turned into a dataframe with info for cats, dogs, their names and their lengths
**02-Billionaires** where I had to work with an .xlsx file on billionaires, and work with info such as their age, their networth, and their company
